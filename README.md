twitter_autoload
================

Automatically loads new tweets to whatever feed you are watching

Ever find yourself keeping a browser tab of twitter open on your secondary screen, wishing that it would just get those new tweets and not require you to click to see them?
Well that (1st world) problem is now in the past. By installing this extension, your twitter feed will never again fall behind the time. As long as your window is scrolled to the top and your not in the middle of writing a tweet yourself, regardless if your on the front page, watching a search result, or a specific person, new tweets will automatically be loaded on to your feed.
